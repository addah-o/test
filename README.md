## Types of GitHub Pages sites

* User
* Organisation

### User/Organization
To publish a user site, you must create a repository owned by your user account that's named <username>.github.io. To publish an organization site, you must create a repository owned by an organization that's named <organization>.github.io. Unless you're using a custom domain, user and organization sites are available at http(s)://<username>.github.io or http(s)://<organization>.github.io.
### Project
**The source files for a project site are stored in the same repository as their project.** Unless you're using a custom domain, project sites are available at http(s)://<username>.github.io/<repository> or http(s)://<organization>.github.io/<repository>.
